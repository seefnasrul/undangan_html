Gaia Bootstrap Template is an one page Bootstrap Template built with components from [Gaia Bootstrap Template PRO](http://demos.creative-tim.com/gaia-bootstrap-template-pro/index.html). Use it FREE for you or for your clients :-)

It comes with 5 colors from the default Bootstrap Style Primary (gold), Info (blue), Success (green), Warning (orange), Danger (Red).

Gaia is also the name of the Greek goddess of Earth, which was one of the inspiration for this template. All color tones used throughout the template are found through nature, soft for the eyes and visually appealing. The main variations follow shades of brown and black. The typography has a light feel and we made use of edge-to-edge images wherever we could.

Besides the templates that you can use as they are, just changing the images and text, Gaia also has room for customization. The color options for the buttons make it easy for you to choose what best fits your needs. According to the main color palette, you will also find multiple filters, text variations and labels.

Icons are provided by [Pixeden](http://themes-pixeden.com/font-demos/7-stroke/).

We are excited to share with you this template and we are eager to hear your feedback. We are hoping it will be as much fun for you to use it as it was for us to create it.
